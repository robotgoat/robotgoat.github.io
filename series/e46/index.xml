        <description>Intro Earlier this year I decided to switch my power steering system in my E46 325ci to the LF30 style pump due it apparently having a more robust design. The LUK branded new pumps at that time were on backorder and still seem to be backordered. I therefore bought a cheap one from Amazon and have now been using it for almost a year.
One Year Review Since installing this pump, I have driven my car almost 10,000 miles and taken it through some very spirited routes in the Smokey Mountains.</description>

        <description>Intro Back when I was performing the full refresh on my neglected, zero maintenance history 325Ci, I opted to save some money and bought the Uro Parts full front suspension kit from Bimmerworld. The same kit is available on RockAuto, the ad of which is shown here. I had purchased it for $245, which seemed like a good deal for control arms, bushings, tie rod inner and outers, and sway bar endlinks.</description>

        <title>BMW E46 ECS Tuning Coilover Review</title>

        <description>8 Month Update April 22, 2022 After having daily driven the ECS Tuning coilovers on my stock 325ci for nearly 8 months, I can now confidently say that they are indeed much too harsh for the pockmarked and rough roads of the midwest. On perfectly smooth roads, these coilovers are great and comfortable, but at the slightest perturbation in the road, the comfort declines drastically. The coilovers clunked a lot and the added stiffness and lack of suspension spring travel put too much torsional stress on the chassis.</description>
