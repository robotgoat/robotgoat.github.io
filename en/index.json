However, being the OCD and cheapskate I am, I wanted to retain full control while maintaining a reasonable budget. This meant deploying cheap Chinese brand cameras that will undoubtedly be phoning home - which has to be addressed on the network through virtual local area networks (VLANS). By implementing VLANs, I not only have an excuse to upgrade to newer networking hardware, but also will be greatly increasing my overall home network security.\nFormerly running a basic Netgear router, the first step was to find a suitable replacement. My internet searches led to me a few options: diy Pfsense router, Mikrotik, or Ubiquity EdgeRouter. After careful consideration, I ultimately decided on purchasing a Mikrotik RB2011 series router. As with any choice, the compromise here is that Mikrotik\u0026rsquo;s settings configuration is not as intuitive as Ubiquity\u0026rsquo;s, but is offset by the cheaper price to performance + features.\nBecause Mikrotik routers might be confusing for beginners first using them, this post will attempt to provide a guide for how to setup VLANs, perhaps the most essential feature of any modern home nework, big or small.\nVLANs As Understood by a Monkey A VLAN is a virtual LAN that essentially acts as a subnet on a single network.\nAs the name suggests, it creates a virtual LAN to make it appear that there exist multiple networks on a single network. To provide sufficient background, I will define some terms needed for understanding:\n VLAN - is a logical grouping, or division of network traffic at the data link layer (layer 2) that divides by broadcast domain router - is a device that connects two or more networks and trasfers data among them switch - is a device on a network that connects other devices on the same network broadcast domain - is broadcasting, the act of sending a signal to all devices on a particular network segment. Every VLAN has its own broadcast domain.  Each VLAN is defined by a VLAN ID that is appended to the packets exiting devices on a defined VLAN port on a switch. This ID is used by the VLAN table on the router and switch(es) to keep network traffic segregated. In order to allow traffic between certain VLANs, firewall rules have to be defined to allow inter-VLAN routing.\nSetting up a Virgin Mikrotik Router The process assumes one is starting from a bone stock router with default factory settings. This process is for the RB2011 series router that contains a seperate switch chip, which requires a slightly different configuration compared to using bridges to create VLANs.\nTo start, login to the router via the Winbox utility. For the initial login, select the MAC address as the router ID. The default user is \u0026ldquo;admin\u0026rdquo; and the password is empty. Make sure to update the password.\nCreate New VLANs First, create the new VLAN interface by selecting the \u0026ldquo;Interfaces\u0026rdquo; button in the column menu on the left. With the Interface List window open, select the \u0026ldquo;VLAN\u0026rdquo; tab -\u0026gt; + icon and create the new VLAN. The important fields to fill out are:\n Name - the name of the VLAN VLAN ID - this is the integer identifier used for tagging traffic that belongs to this VLAN. 1 is the default so you want to change it to something like 10, 20, 30, etc. Interface - is source interface the VLAN comes from. In this case, we will be using all the ports on the LAN, which correponds to the default \u0026ldquo;bridge\u0026rdquo; interface in the dropdown menu.  Interface Menu\nAdd new VLAN\nAdd IP Addresses for VLANs Next, we need create an address range for the newly created VLAN. Select \u0026ldquo;IP\u0026rdquo; -\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Addresses\u0026rdquo; from the column menu. Click the + to add a new address. The two selections to fill out are:\n Address - the address range. You can choose whatever you would like. An example range would be 192.168.60.1/24, which signifies the range of addresses from 192.168.60.1-255. Interface - will be the VLAN interface we created earlier.  Create DHCP Servers for VLANs Next, select from the menu \u0026ldquo;IP\u0026rdquo; -\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;DHCP Server\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;DHCP\u0026rdquo; tab. Here, the virtual DHCP server for the VLAN is created by going through the handy wizard by clicking the \u0026ldquo;DHCP Setup.\u0026rdquo; Follow the wizard and ensure the interface is the VLAN interface and the correct IP address range.\nChange name of Address Pool (Optional) The DHCP server wizard automatically creates the Address Pool and sets a default name. If so inclined, the name can be changed by selecting \u0026ldquo;IP\u0026rdquo; -\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Pool\u0026rdquo; from the column menu.\nIf using a custom DNS server for the VLAN, it can be changed by selecting the \u0026ldquo;Networks\u0026rdquo; tab in the DHCP Server window. Double click the address range that corresponds to the VLAN and input in the custom DNS server IP.\nConfigure Switch Chip Next, we need to actually tell the router which of its physical ports belong to a particular VLAN. Because the RB2011 and 3011 series routers have hardware switch chips that handle this, it is best to take advantage of them and configure hardware VLANs via the switch chips.\nIn the column menu, select \u0026ldquo;Switch\u0026rdquo; -\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;VLAN\u0026rdquo; to assign VLAN ID(s) to a port.\nClick the + to add assign port(s) to a VLAN. In this case, the RB2011 has two switch chips. Switch1 controls eth1-5 and switch2 controls eth6-10. In the image above, I have added some rules already. Let\u0026rsquo;s break down the first rule. On switch1, there\u0026rsquo;s VLAN ID of 107 on ports ether4, switch1 cpu. This effectively tells the switch chip that port ether4 that it belongs on the VLAN 107 network. Note, it is important to select switch1 cpu for this to work.\nNext, select the Port tab for additional configuration.\nLet us continue with the example of adding VLAN 107 to ether4. Double click the ether4 row to edit its settings. In this case, I want all traffic from port 4 to be exclusively part of VLAN 107, so VLAN Mode has to be set to secure. VLAN Header has to be \u0026ldquo;always strip\u0026rdquo; becasue this is an access port and thus the VLAN tag must be removed on egress traffic. Lastly, because this is an acess port, the Default VLAN ID must be defined, which in this case is 107.\nBefore moving on, we must configure switch1_cpu as well. In my case, I have tagged and untagged traffic that is handled by switch1\u0026rsquo;s ports, so set VLAN Mode to fallback. VLAN Header must be \u0026ldquo;leave as is\u0026rdquo; because we have hybrid ports and default VLAN ID is 1. For further information on switch chip features, see the official Mikrotik Wiki: https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:Switch_Chip_Features.\nFirewall Rules Lastly, and most importantly we must define the firewall rules to ensure VLAN network security. But before this, I like to define interface lists for the VLANs to make it easier and safer when defining firewall rules.\nInterface Lists To create an interface list, select Interface -\u0026gt; Interface List from the column menu. Then click the \u0026ldquo;Lists\u0026rdquo; button to open up the \u0026ldquo;Interface Lists\u0026rdquo; window. Press the + to create a new interface list and simply give it a name and press ok.\nThis newly created list will appear in the Interface Lists window\u0026rsquo;s list. As can be seen, I have GUEST, IP Cams, and IoT in addition to the defconf lists. Exit the interface lists window and in the interface list tab, press the + to add a new interface list member. Choose the list name and select the VLAN interface for which it belongs to. Presto done.\nEssential Firewall Rules Now select IP -\u0026gt; Firewall to add the additional firewall rules to take advantage of VLANs and enable intervlan routing. The first rule I like to add is to allow the LAN access to the internet. You may wonder why when there is already internet access. This is to preempt the next rule which is a blanket blocking of all undefined connections.\nClick the blue + to add the new rule. In the Firewall Rule window -\u0026gt; General, ensure Chain is foward. In Interface List is LAN and Out Interface List is WAN. Under the action tab, ensure accept is selected. To allow intervlan routing between the LAN and the VLAN, you will use the same exact setting, but replace the Out Interface List with the name of the VLAN interface list create above.\nThe last and most important rule is to block all other traffic.\nAdd a new rule via the blue + with the following settings:\n General -\u0026gt; chain: forward Action -\u0026gt; drop  Comment these rules to your desire for readability. That is all, you have implemented VLANs on a Mikrotik router!\nReferences  https://www.computernetworkingnotes.com/ccna-study-guide/vlan-basic-concepts-explained-with-examples.html https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:Switch_Chip_Features  ","description":"Guide on setting up VLANs on the Mikrotik RB2011 router via Winbox utility","id":2,"section":"posts","tags":["networking","mikrotik"],"title":"Mikrotik Rb2011 VLAN Guide (Winbox)","uri":"https://spiffygoose.com/en/posts/2021_02_24_mikrotik-rb2011-vlan/"},{"content":"Why Did I Buy It? I have been driving my 10th gen Honda Civic for a few years now, but never ended up feeling attached to it since buying my E46 330Ci a couple years ago. Since getting a taste of the BMW experience, I have also been wanting of a more luxurious car that offers great dynamics, ergonomics, and comfort (NVH is a huge letdown in the Civic). Or it could be me just getting old. Replacing a modern Honda with an old BMW, crazy huh?\nDuring my online searches, I came across a very reasonably priced 1999 740iL very close to me that I absolutely had to check out. Upon talking to the owner and doing a cursory inspection to the best of my abilities, the little gremlin in my mind was already telling me to buy it. So, I bought it the following week and I do not regret it at all.\nThe E38 Current Issues Naturally, any neglected or even slightly neglected BMW will present itself with problems. As the images indicate, the main visual flaw is the damaged front bumper, fog lights, and ambient temperature sensor. Inside the car, the instrument cluster indicates the infamous \u0026ldquo;trifecta\u0026rdquo; that points to a faulty ABS module. The interior headliner is also drooping in several areas and the HID lowbeams are throwing an error. However, all the major items (eg radio display, MID, almost all speakers, cup holders, 12V power outlet) work without issue. The MID is showing showing some dead pixels however.\nProject Plans for 2021 I intend to address all main issues warranted of a BMW of this vintage starting early spring of 2021. The goal is to proof the E38 so that it can supplant my Honda as my daily driver. To make this possible, the following is the current plan of action for the car in no particular order:\n full cooling system refresh (yes I know absolutely mandatory for these BMWs 😜)  will be testing the Chinese made Rein expansion tank from FCPEuro to save a little compared to the BMW OEM one   timing chain guide and tensioner job and ancilliary components for the M62TUB44 full suspension refresh  control arms and all bushings BC Racing coilovers   all fluids replace  Redline ATF for ZF auto transmission Castrol engine oil   radio/head unit replacement with new amp and speakers  review of Crutchfield 5Ch PicoNano amp in the future single din Pioneer or Sony to replace the stock tape deck and DSP unit retrofit rear deck 5.25in woofers with something different   interior deep clean headliner replacement send ABS module for rebuilding replace front bumper and bumper liner + repaint replace fog lights and lowbeam headlights polish headlights and apply coating retrofit a new 12V cigarette outlet with voltmeter + 12V lube window regulators new wheels and tires for spring through autumn seasons re-affix window trim and door trim and replenish any rubber seals replace missing jack pads 2x new brakes (pads, rotors, caliper rebuild, fluids) and stainless steel lines replace parking brake handle or modify existing broken one to make more robust remove old window tint and get new tint maybe  This car is very much a learning experience for me and I will be documenting the process in this blog series. In the meantime, we wait for the temperatures to rise! ❄️ ❄️ ❄️\n","description":"Introducing my new BMW that will become my new daily driver.","id":3,"section":"posts","tags":["BMW","E38"],"title":"My New E38 Project","uri":"https://spiffygoose.com/en/posts/2021_02_19_new-e38/"},{"content":"Hello, welcome to my blog.
