        <description>Intro When I picked up my E46 coupe from the seller and drove it home, I noticed the power steering system would make a groaning noise whenever I turned the wheel at a standstill or low speeds. Now that I have the car on jacks, I decided to replace the entire power steering system (hoses, reservoir, and powers steering pump).
The OEM pump that&amp;rsquo;s in my car is the LUK LF20 style pump.</description>

        <description>Wiring Color Guide This color guide has been accurate when replacing the factory speaker and amplifier in my 2004 330Ci and 2001 325Ci. To double check, you can simply test continuity with a multimeter.

        <description>Backstory During the summer of last year in height of the covid fiasco and right after the hurricane, I had the brilliant idea to buy this 2001 BMW 325Ci coupe. I had found this on the e46fanatics forum&amp;rsquo;s classifieds section and was immediately enamored by the Tannin red interior paired with Alpine white exterior. Initially, I was convincing myself to not even consider inquiring and focus on my already present 2004 330Ci convertible.</description>

        <description>Motivation To increase the security of my property, I decided to install IP surveillence cameras in high traffic areas. However, being the OCD and cheapskate I am, I wanted to retain full control while maintaining a reasonable budget. This meant deploying cheap Chinese brand cameras that will undoubtedly be phoning home - which has to be addressed on the network through virtual local area networks (VLANS). By implementing VLANs, I not only have an excuse to upgrade to newer networking hardware, but also will be greatly increasing my overall home network security.</description>

        <description>Why Did I Buy It? I have been driving my 10th gen Honda Civic for a few years now, but never ended up feeling attached to it since buying my E46 330Ci a couple years ago. Since getting a taste of the BMW experience, I have also been wanting of a more luxurious car that offers great dynamics, ergonomics, and comfort (NVH is a huge letdown in the Civic). Or it could be me just getting old.</description>
