        <description>Intro The CCV/PCV design on older BMWs from the late 90s to 2000s leave a lot to be desired. The E46 generation with the M54 engine is plagued by faulty CCV hosing and diaphram designs as well as poorly functioning cylinder rings. Having had experience troubleshooting and eventually bypassing the OEM CCV setup, I figured why not do the same on the E38 with its M62tu engine as the design is not that different.</description>

        <description>Intro Windows is increasingly becoming a hassle to use. Ads in your start menu, spying and telemetry of your local files, bogus hadware security restrictions, and more. Over the past few years, using any variant of Linux has become more than feasible as your daily driver, especially when it comes to playing games. Lutris is a great way to manage and launch your games, even Windows native games as there&amp;rsquo;s a Wine version speficially for playing games using Lutris.</description>

        <description>Intro Earlier this year I decided to switch my power steering system in my E46 325ci to the LF30 style pump due it apparently having a more robust design. The LUK branded new pumps at that time were on backorder and still seem to be backordered. I therefore bought a cheap one from Amazon and have now been using it for almost a year.
One Year Review Since installing this pump, I have driven my car almost 10,000 miles and taken it through some very spirited routes in the Smokey Mountains.</description>

        <description>Intro Back when I was performing the full refresh on my neglected, zero maintenance history 325Ci, I opted to save some money and bought the Uro Parts full front suspension kit from Bimmerworld. The same kit is available on RockAuto, the ad of which is shown here. I had purchased it for $245, which seemed like a good deal for control arms, bushings, tie rod inner and outers, and sway bar endlinks.</description>

        <description>Addendum To The Solution While replacing the other crimped hoses on the car, I revisited the fuel hose solution. I am a proponent of the KISS (keep it simple, stupid) philosophy and opted to remove the complicated crimp setup on the fuel line coming from the filter. To simplify the hose attachment, the simpler solution is to simply create a raised ring around the metal tube where the fuel hose attaches.</description>

        <title>BMW E38 Electric Fan Conversion</title>

        <description>Intro A common modification/upgrade on older BMWs is the removal of the pulley driven engine fan on the water pump and installation of an electrically driven fan. This modification is easy on E46, but slightly more difficult on E38 and E39 as they did not come with a main electric fan from the factory. This modification is performed to reduce the risk of the mechanical fan&amp;rsquo;s blades from shattering, potentially causing havoc to the engine.</description>

        <description>Intro In my previous post, I had detailed a rather rudimentary guide to setting up VLANs on the Mikrotik RB2011 series of routers utilizing the switch chips. As an end of year network audit, I found that the setup I had been using was incomplete and consequently, the first guide on this website is also lacking. To remedy this error, this is version 2 of the RB2011 VLAN guide. The following steps assume you start on the default configuration of the router.</description>

        <description>8 Month Update April 22, 2022 After having daily driven the ECS Tuning coilovers on my stock 325ci for nearly 8 months, I can now confidently say that they are indeed much too harsh for the pockmarked and rough roads of the midwest. On perfectly smooth roads, these coilovers are great and comfortable, but at the slightest perturbation in the road, the comfort declines drastically. The coilovers clunked a lot and the added stiffness and lack of suspension spring travel put too much torsional stress on the chassis.</description>

        <description>Intro When I picked up my E46 coupe from the seller and drove it home, I noticed the power steering system would make a groaning noise whenever I turned the wheel at a standstill or low speeds. Now that I have the car on jacks, I decided to replace the entire power steering system (hoses, reservoir, and powers steering pump).
The OEM pump that&amp;rsquo;s in my car is the LUK LF20 style pump.</description>

        <description>Backstory During the summer of last year in height of the covid fiasco and right after the hurricane, I had the brilliant idea to buy this 2001 BMW 325Ci coupe. I had found this on the e46fanatics forum&amp;rsquo;s classifieds section and was immediately enamored by the Tannin red interior paired with Alpine white exterior. Initially, I was convincing myself to not even consider inquiring and focus on my already present 2004 330Ci convertible.</description>

        <description>THIS POST IS DEPRECATED. PLEASE VISIT THE UPDATED VERSION HERE: https://www.spiffygoose.com/en/posts/2021_12_25_revised-mikrotik-rb2011-series-vlan-guide/
Motivation To increase the security of my property, I decided to install IP surveillence cameras in high traffic areas. However, being the OCD and cheapskate I am, I wanted to retain full control while maintaining a reasonable budget. This meant deploying cheap Chinese brand cameras that will undoubtedly be phoning home - which has to be addressed on the network through virtual local area networks (VLANS).</description>

        <description>Why Did I Buy It? I have been driving my 10th gen Honda Civic for a few years now, but never ended up feeling attached to it since buying my E46 330Ci a couple years ago. Since getting a taste of the BMW experience, I have also been wanting of a more luxurious car that offers great dynamics, ergonomics, and comfort (NVH is a huge letdown in the Civic). Or it could be me just getting old.</description>
