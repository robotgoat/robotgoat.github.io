        <description>Intro The average E38 7 series as of now is older than 20 years. With 2 decades of time, parts wear and break down. This includes the audio hardware. The original speakers in the E38 are paper woofers that have undoubtedly all degraded by now. While it may be simple to buy the original replacements, it&amp;rsquo;s most likely not sensible as inventory diminishes and prices increase. Instead, a better way to tackle this is to moderinize the audio system with bigger and better components tha have modern features like Bluetooth.</description>

        <description>8 Month Update April 22, 2022 After having daily driven the ECS Tuning coilovers on my stock 325ci for nearly 8 months, I can now confidently say that they are indeed much too harsh for the pockmarked and rough roads of the midwest. On perfectly smooth roads, these coilovers are great and comfortable, but at the slightest perturbation in the road, the comfort declines drastically. The coilovers clunked a lot and the added stiffness and lack of suspension spring travel put too much torsional stress on the chassis.</description>

        <description>Why Did I Buy It? I have been driving my 10th gen Honda Civic for a few years now, but never ended up feeling attached to it since buying my E46 330Ci a couple years ago. Since getting a taste of the BMW experience, I have also been wanting of a more luxurious car that offers great dynamics, ergonomics, and comfort (NVH is a huge letdown in the Civic). Or it could be me just getting old.</description>
