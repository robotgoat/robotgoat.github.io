        <description>Intro Earlier this year I decided to switch my power steering system in my E46 325ci to the LF30 style pump due it apparently having a more robust design. The LUK branded new pumps at that time were on backorder and still seem to be backordered. I therefore bought a cheap one from Amazon and have now been using it for almost a year.
One Year Review Since installing this pump, I have driven my car almost 10,000 miles and taken it through some very spirited routes in the Smokey Mountains.</description>

        <description>Intro Back when I was performing the full refresh on my neglected, zero maintenance history 325Ci, I opted to save some money and bought the Uro Parts full front suspension kit from Bimmerworld. The same kit is available on RockAuto, the ad of which is shown here. I had purchased it for $245, which seemed like a good deal for control arms, bushings, tie rod inner and outers, and sway bar endlinks.</description>
