## Why Did I Buy It?

I have been driving my 10th gen Honda Civic for a few years now, but never ended up feeling attached to it since buying my E46 330Ci a couple years ago. Since getting a taste of the BMW experience, I have also been wanting of a more luxurious car that offers great dynamics, ergonomics, and comfort (NVH is a huge letdown in the Civic). Or it could be me just getting old. Replacing a modern Honda with an old BMW, crazy huh?

During my online searches, I came across a very reasonably priced 1999 740iL very close to me that I absolutely had to check out. Upon talking to the owner and doing a cursory inspection to the best of my abilities, the little gremlin in my mind was already telling me to buy it. So, I bought it the following week and I do not regret it at all.

## The E38

## Current Issues

Naturally, any neglected or even slightly neglected BMW will present itself with problems. As the images indicate, the main visual flaw is the damaged front bumper, fog lights, and ambient temperature sensor. Inside the car, the instrument cluster indicates the infamous "trifecta" that points to a faulty ABS module. The interior headliner is also drooping in several areas and the HID lowbeams are throwing an error. However, all the major items (eg radio display, MID, almost all speakers, cup holders, 12V power outlet) work without issue. The MID is showing showing some dead pixels however. 

## Project Plans for 2021

I intend to address all main issues warranted of a BMW of this vintage starting early spring of 2021. The goal is to proof the E38 so that it can supplant my Honda as my daily driver. To make this possible, the following is the current plan of action for the car in no particular order:

- full cooling system refresh (yes I know absolutely mandatory for these BMWs :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)
    - will be testing the Chinese made Rein expansion tank from FCPEuro to save a little compared to the BMW OEM one
- timing chain guide and tensioner job and ancilliary components for the M62TUB44
- full suspension refresh
    - control arms and all bushings
    - BC Racing coilovers
- all fluids replace
    - Redline ATF for ZF auto transmission
    - Castrol engine oil
- radio/head unit replacement with new amp and speakers
    - review of Crutchfield 5Ch PicoNano amp in the future
    - single din Pioneer or Sony to replace the stock tape deck and DSP unit
    - retrofit rear deck 5.25in woofers with something different
- interior deep clean
- headliner replacement
- send ABS module for rebuilding 
- replace front bumper and bumper liner + repaint
- replace fog lights and lowbeam headlights
- polish headlights and apply coating
- retrofit a new 12V cigarette outlet with voltmeter + 12V
- lube window regulators
- new wheels and tires for spring through autumn seasons
- re-affix window trim and door trim and replenish any rubber seals
- replace missing jack pads 2x
- new brakes (pads, rotors, caliper rebuild, fluids) and stainless steel lines
- replace parking brake handle or modify existing broken one to make more robust
- remove old window tint and get new tint maybe

This car is very much a learning experience for me and I will be documenting the process in this blog series. In the meantime, we wait for the temperatures to rise! :snowflake: :snowflake: :snowflake:
