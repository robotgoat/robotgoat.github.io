## Intro

The BMW E38 7 series is now approaching classic status with the earlier model years already at 25 years of age. As the E38 generation approaches nearly 2 decades on average, it is important to replace the numerous wear and tear items that decay with age, most notably fuel hoses. 

## The Problem

The fuel rail on the M62tu engine poses a slight problem in this restoration of fuel hoses. The problem lies in the design of the rubber fuel hose that connects to the fuel rail: it is crimped on the rail and terminates with a BMW quick connect fitting. This post documents how I go about replacing this hose without spending the hundreds on a new fuel rail and hose part from BMW.
